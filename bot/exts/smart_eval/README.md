## Well hello there...
I see you've come to see how we've managed an intelligence as incredible as Sir Robin's Smart Eval command!

Well the answer is a return to basics, specifically going back to the roots of [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA).

We welcome others to contribute to the intelligence of the `&smarte` command. If you have more responses or situations you want to capture
then feel free to contribute new regex rules or responses to existing regex rules. You're also welcome to expand on the
existing capability of how `&smarte` works or our `&donate` command.
